Moon Discord Server Annouchments:

As the lead UI developer, I want to address the current situation regarding Moon. Unless **we** explicitly state that Moon is being discontinued, development will continue as planned. We are actively working on it every day, and I want to assure you that we can replace old developers with new ones without any concerns. We are already in discussions with a new developer whom I trust completely and who has a proven track record.

Regarding the previous DLL developer, "cpkq," it’s important to clarify that he lacked a basic understanding of DLL execution and injection within Roblox. His departure came after I called him on his bullshit since he would never really provide any proof of anything he claimed working and done within his DLL and I was always suspicious of him because he seemed retarded honestly. Unfortunately, this resulted in him scamming <@1032919756409405480> , who had already paid him. Now that we have taken out the garbage we can focus and what we all came here to complete, Moon Executor.

Rest assured, I am committed to this project because I believe in its potential to be a successful and well-functioning product. Thank you for your continued support.


Please make sure to read this, since this is a very important message
which, I would recommend you read! It will tell you lots about the 
future of moon, and also the approximate release date. Thank you
for your time!

Moon drama, clearing everything up.
Hello everyone, I heard a lot of people asking what's happening to
moon or is moon really legit, after what savage and cpkq said about us.
Well I just want to debunk the situation and also expose both of
them since they are currently trying to ruin our reputation etc.

I would first of all like to address that Lumina will never release and
Lunar will most likely not release anytime soon if not at all. They are
most likely giving us a bad reputation due to them seeing us as rivals
or new competition. This is most likely due to us having an advanced
development team who are all skilled and experienced! I would also
like to address that cpkq uses roblox studio to fake all his sneak peaks,
by using remote events that activated the console to make it look like
he injected/execute something. Click here for the proof. Im sure most
of you have seen the Lunar drama by now, however if you haven't then
here is the link to it. So this was just regarding and clearing up all the
drama about moon executor.

The future of Moon.
As said previously by our lead UI developer, moon's development will
continue as planned and we are also currently talking to a very well
known and respected developer for our API/DLL. We are dedicated to
make this the best executor possible! We also are getting asked when
is the approximate date for release is. I will try and give a rough
answer of maybe late June to mid July. Remember this is a guess and
not an official date. We will keep you updated on our progress, and also
soon announce the features of our executor! We thank you all for being
supportive and just overall being such an amazing community! We all
thank and appreciate all of you <3!

Thank you for understanding!

Warm Regards,

Moon-Executor Team.

Moon-Exec features.
Hey everyone, I would just like to adress some things about moon and
it's features breaking down each and every feature so you guys can get
a better understanding of what our executor will look like upon release!

:scroll: Script Decompiler:

Our advanced decompiler, can easily decompile any scripts from any
game with ease. This will have an extremely high success rate meaning
this could be perfect for developers who like to make roblox games!

:white_check_mark: High UNC/Level 7:

Our advanced DLL, ensures that you should be able to run any script
without any trouble! This means that you can finally stop worrying
about having to find scripts that are compatible with that executor and
instead just use your favorite scripts!


:mag: Script Hub:

Our advanced script hub, has over 10k+ scripts which are safe and also
easy to use! This means that if you need a script but cannot find one
rather than going on google and looking for ages just for one script,
you can just look up your desired script in our explorer and you can
execute it from there!

:desktop: Multi Instance:

Our advanced multi instance support, means you can run multiple
roblox clients at one time, meaning you can afk in one game while
playing another!
